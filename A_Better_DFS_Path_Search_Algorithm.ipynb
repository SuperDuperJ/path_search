    "In many places online one can find the following recursive depth-first path search algorithm.  I first encountered this algorithm when taking a course on Algorithms and Data Structures from Codecademy.com.  On Codecademy and other websites it is claimed that this algorithm will always produce a path (if one exists) from the current_vertex to the target_vertex.  As we will see, this is not always true."
