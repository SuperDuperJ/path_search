# path_search
This repository contains both depth-first and breadth-first posth search algorithms.  The highlight is an original variation of the standard depth-first path search algorithm.  This variation will always produce a path from the start vertex to the target vertex (if one exists) as opposed to the standard algorithm that simply returns the visited array.
